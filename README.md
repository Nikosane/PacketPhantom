## Overview
This project demonstrates ARP poisoning to facilitate a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. It redirects traffic between a victim and a gateway to the attacker's machine, allowing packet interception or modification.

⚠️ **Ethical Use Only:** Use this tool responsibly and only with explicit permission on networks you own or are authorized to test.

## Features
- ARP spoofing to redirect traffic.
- IP forwarding to maintain network connectivity.
- Automatic restoration of ARP tables after the attack.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Root or Administrator privileges
- `scapy` library
